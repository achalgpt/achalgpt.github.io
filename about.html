        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’m Achal Gupta, a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Cape Town with a deep-rooted passion for space, sustainability, and systems that make the world work better. I’ve represented Botswana internationally at the International Mathematical Olympiad, volunteered at the International Astronomical Union’s General Assembly, and currently lead the UCT Space Society’s participation in the African Rover Challenge with our <strong>Cars4Mars</strong> project.</p>

        <p>I’ve been fascinated by the cosmos since I was six—when I cracked open my first encyclopedia and started asking the kind of questions that don’t fit into multiple choice answers. I thrive at the intersection of logic and imagination, whether it’s in the lab, behind a camera, or writing about African development, neoliberalism, and plastic pollution (and winning essay competitions for it).</p>

        <p>Right now, I’m building robots, launching rockets, and trying not to forget how to sleep. But the dream is bigger: to push Africa’s role in space science forward, with engineering as my toolkit and storytelling as my sidearm.</p>
